      <h1>Purpose of the web site</h1>

      <p>
        The P2P Food Lab web site is dedicated to gardeners and food
        enthousiasts who wish to collaborate on the production,
        preparing, sharing and composting of food in local
        communities. The web site allows them to upload textual and
        visual notes about their gardening/food activities.
      </p>

      <p>
        Related topics, such as sustainability, collaborative economy,
        and citizen science, are also welcome subjects for discussion.
      </p>

      <p>
        The web site allows participants to communicate with each
        other to share ideas, advice, observations, measurements,
        questions and answers, and other information that related to
        the topics mentioned above.
      </p>

      <p>
        P2P Food Lab has also
        designed <a href="http://p2pfoodlab.net">greenhouses and
        sensorboxes</a>. The data of the sensorboxes can be linked to
        and visualised on this site.
      </p>

      <p>
        The P2P Food Lab will no doubt evolve over time and new
        features may be added at any time. If any of the features
        significantly changes the purpose of the site, the P2P Food
        Lab staff will clearly announce these changes.
      </p>

      <h1>Registration</h1>

      <p>
        Anyone can register provided they have an interest in the
        topic of web site. There is no need to have a greenhouse or
        sensorbox installled in order to register.
      </p>
