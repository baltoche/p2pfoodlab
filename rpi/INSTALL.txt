How to install the sensobox software on the RPi
-----------------------------------------------

Part 1

1. Install Raspbian on a >4GB CD card.
   See http://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads

2. Put the SD card in the RPi and boot the little device. In the blue
   configuration screen (raspi-config), do the following:

   - expand the file system.
   - set the graphics card memory to a minimum (16MB)
   - enable the SSH server
   - disable the desktop at startup.

3. Log into the RPi. Make sure that you have network access. Then run
   the following command:

$ wget https://github.com/hanappe/p2pfoodlab/raw/master/rpi/install-p2pfoodlab.sh
$ sudo bash install-p2pfoodlab.sh


    NOTE: This installation script is meant for Raspberry Pi's that
      will be used exclusively as a sensorbox. The installation script
      overwrites existing configuration files without a warning,
      including the Apache2 configuration files. Don't run the script
      on a RPi that you're already using for other purposes.

4. Download and install the Arduino IDE on your laptop:
   http://arduino.cc/en/main/software

5. Download the code for the Arduino in the sensorbox:

$ wget https://github.com/hanappe/p2pfoodlab/archive/master.zip
$ unzip master.zip

   This will create a directory called p2pfoodlab-master.

   Open the Arduino IDE application, import the library
   p2pfoodlab-master/arduino/DHT22.zip (Menu: Sketch > Import
   Library). See also http://arduino.cc/en/Guide/Libraries
   
6. Connect the Arduino to your PC using an USB cable and the FTDI
   USB-to-Serial adapter (http://arduino.cc/en/Guide/ArduinoProMini).

   In the Arduino IDE, open the sketch
   p2pfoodlab-master/arduino/p2pfoodlab/p2pfoodlab.ino

   In the Tools > Board menu, select "Arduino Pro Mini (3.3V, 8MHz) w/
   ATmega328". 

   In Tools > Serial Port menu, make sure you have the right port
   selected (trial and error?).


Part 3

7. Plug in the USB WiFi, the webcam, and then reboot the RPi.

8. Connect the RPi to a laptop/PC using a cross-cable. The laptop
   should be configured to obtain an IP address automatically using
   DHCP. 
  
9. Start a web browser and go to the address http://192.168.3.14/ 
   Log in to the configuration web site. The default password is
   'p2pfoodlab'.

10. Configure the different sections of the sensorbox:

   - The WiFi settings of your network

   - Give a name to the sensorbox and provide the OpenSensorData.net
     key to upload the data

   - Set the period with which you want to upload the data, and the
     webcam photos.

   - Add your public SSH key to the SSH section (needed for the
     optional test below).

     On Linux, copy the output of the command below:

     $ cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub

     If you don't have any SSH keys, you can generate them as follows:

     $ ssh-keygen -t rsa


11. To test the communication with the Arduino, ssh into the RPi and
    execute the following commands:

    $ i2cdetect -y 1

    This should show the presence of the Arduino at the address 04.

    $ /var/p2pfoodlab/bin/arduino millis

    This should return the current clock count of the Arduino.

12. To verify that the data upload:
    - On the RPi, check the ID of the data group:
      $ cat /etc/opensensordata/group.json
    - Write down the ID of the group.
    - Go to the web page
      http://opensensordata.net/viewgroup/<ID>.csv

13. Sit back and relax.
