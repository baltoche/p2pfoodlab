How to install the sensobox software on the RPi
-----------------------------------------------

1. Install Raspbian on a >4GB CD card.
   See http://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads

2. Put the SD card in the RPi and boot the little device. In the blue
   configuration screen (raspi-config), do the following:

   - expand the file system.
   - set the graphics card memory to a minimum (16MB)
   - enable the SSH server
   - disable the desktop at startup.

3. Log into the RPi. Make sure that you have network access. Then run
   the following command:

$ wget https://github.com/hanappe/p2pfoodlab/raw/master/rpi/install-p2pfoodlab.sh
$ sudo bash install-p2pfoodlab.sh


NOTE: This installation script is meant for Raspberry Pi's that will
      be used exclusively as a sensorbox. It overwrites some
      configuration files, such as the Apache2 configuration
      files. Don't run it on a RPi that you're already using for other
      projects.

4. Plug in the USB WiFi, the webcam, and then reboot the RPi.

5. Connect the RPi to a laptop/PC using a cross-cable. The laptop
  should be configured to obtain an IP address automatically using
  DHCP.

6. Start a web browser and go to the address http://192.168.3.14/ 
   Log in to the configuration web site. The default password is
   'p2pfoodlab'.

7. Configure the different sections of the sensorbox:

   - The WiFi settings of your network

   - Give a name to the sensorbox and provide the OpenSensorData.net
     key to upload the data

   - Set the period with which you want to upload the data, and the
     webcam photos.

8. Sit back and relax.
